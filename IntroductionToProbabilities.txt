	Chance behaviour

This is unpredicatbel in the short run, but has a reguar and predictabble pattern in the long run (Law of Large Numbers)

Emperical Probability

Emperical Probabilities ae found through observaitons, not theorizing or calculator

A random phenomenon is one whose individual outcomes are uncertain but there is nontheless a regualr distribution of outcomes in a large number repititions.

The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times an even would occur in a. very long series of independent repititions.

Probability Model:

Sample Space "S" : a set of all possible outcomes.
Event: Any outcome or set of outcomes of a random phenomenon; is a subset of the sample space

Tree diagrams ☺️

Tree diagrams are for listing a sample s[ace and finding the probability of a sequence of events regardless of whether they are independent or dependent

Multiplication Principle

n1 * n2

Sampling without replacement : Independent
Sampling with replacement : Dependent

********The dependent setting can be considered independent if the population is over ten time the sample size. ********

5 Probability rules
1) Probability lies between 0 and 1
2) If S is sample space, Probability of S = 1
3) If A and B are disjoint(mutually exclusive) if they have no outcomes in common and so can never occur simultaneoously; probs are added
***Disjoint events are dependent events. However, dependent events are not automatically disjoint
4)The compliment of event A, is that A does not occur; hence it is 1 - p(A)
5)If A and B are independent, then the probs are multiplied.
***Depending on what information is given, this can e mathematical check for independence.
